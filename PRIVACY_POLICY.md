## [App name]: Privacy policy

Welcome to the [App name] app for Android and iOS!

This is an open source app developed by Andy Ryan. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

I am an avid proponent of privacy and I take it very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

#### `Permission` - Why it is required

##### Android

`android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM` - Introduced in Android 13 (API level 33), this permission allows the app to set an exact alarm with the Android system, ensuring that the system will wake up from doze mode when the alarm rings. Granted by the system by default and cannot be revoked by the user. Requested in Android 13 and above.

##### iOs

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Andy Ryan
